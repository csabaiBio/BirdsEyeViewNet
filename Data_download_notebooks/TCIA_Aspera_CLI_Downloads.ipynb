        "# Summary\n",
        "Much of non-DICOM content in [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) is provided via links to IBM Aspera Faspex packages.  Aspera’s FASP protocol is designed to move data rapidly across networks with minimal disruption to other traffic.  Aspera’s Faspex application bundles data into packages that can be referenced via a web link (i.e., a URI).  When an Aspera Faspex link resolves in a browser, it presents a GUI that guides a user through the process of installing a browser extension and a local Aspera Connect client, if not already there, that moves the data using FASP between TCIA servers and the computer the browser is running on.\n",
        "We frequently get requests from researchers for an option to download TCIA Faspex packages using a command line interface, suitable for inclusion in shell/batch scripts, that bypasses the GUI.  While not a part of the standard Aspera distributions, the IBM Aspera developers have provided an open source tool (Apache 2.0 license) called ascli (aspera-cli) that allows a client to download an Aspera Faspex package using its URI.\n"
